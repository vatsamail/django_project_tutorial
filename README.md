# Django Learning
## Through a simple voting app
### Credits:  [Django Project](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro)


Everybody should **play** with at least one Django project before they hop on to a new adventure in Django.
This repository will *methodically* takes one through various Django features.
I will **strongly** recommend you to refer the given web portal for detailed documentation.

In this repository, We are building a **voting system** using *Sqlite* relational database with *Python 3*.

I have developed this on Windows system but can be easily ported to Linux or MacOS without any glitch.
I encourage everybody to use **virtualenv**. My installed packages and the python version are mentioned in the folder.

We will develop an *app* called **'polls'** under **'mysite'**
The *tutorial* covers all the **7 chapters** and a bonus chapter about *creating reusable apps* and I have made sure to commit after every chapter.
This will help anyone to start at any stage.
