Everybody should play with at least one Django project before they hop on to a new adventure in Django.
This link - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/  methodically takes one through various Django features.
We are building an voting system using Sqlite relational database. I have developed this on windows env but can be easily ported to linux without any glitch.
I encourage everybody to use virtualenv. My installed packages and the python version are mentioned in the folder.
We will develop an app called 'polls' under 'mysite'
The *tutorial* covers all the 7 chapters and I have made sure to commit after every chapter. This will help anyone to start at any stage.
